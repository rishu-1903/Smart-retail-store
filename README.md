Smart Retail Store: Sales Analytics & Anomaly Detection

This project simulates a smart retail store system that:
- Generates synthetic sales data,
- Computes profit and loss per transaction,
- Uses **AI-based anomaly detection (Isolation Forest)** to flag unusual sales behavior,
- Summarizes store-wise performance, and
- Visualizes profits across stores.
